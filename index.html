                <p>We are fully operational at the moment but due to Covid19 the demand for skip hire is at an all time
                    high whilst staff shortages prove challenging.</p>
                <p>We will endeavour to ensure availability in your area but we request some flexibility on the exact
                    dates while the impact of Covid19 is still impacting the industry</p>

                                    Consider where your skip will be positioned before ordering and how the lorry will
                                    gain access. Narrow gates, walls and driveways can stop the lorry from delivering to
                                    your property. If you have concerns then please contact us before ordering. Be aware
                                    that skip lorries can often weigh up to 16 tonnes which can place a lot of strain on
                                    driveways, especially when removing a full skip. This is a risk you accept when
                                    placing your order.

                                    <p>The cheapest way to order a skip is have it delivered onto your property, such as

                                        highway then a permit will need to be applied for. When placing your order,
                                        please select the permit option as we will need to apply for this on your behalf
                                        through the local council. The permit will last for one month at which point the
                                        skip will need to be collected.</p>
                                    <p>We will apply for a permit on your requested date but if the council has delays
                                        then we will accept the next available date offered by the council and duly
                                        deliver your skip on that date notifying you of this change.</p>

                    or moved before the end of the Hire Period, we or our Skip Hire Partner is required to collect or

                    to
                    (other than where it is our fault or that of our Skip Hire Partner), collect the skip at the end of

                    our
                    Order; (h)any other applicable additional costs; or (i)in the event of damage to, or the loss of,
                    the
                    skip whilst it is at the Hire Location, where such damage or loss is a result of your failure to
                    comply
                    with the terms of this Contract, an additional cost to cover the repair or replacement of the skip,
                    excluding the cost of damage caused by fair wear and tear, (“Additional Costs”).
                    We may charge you Additional Costs in accordance with our then current prices as notified to you
                    either
                    on our website or over the telephone when you are placing your Order. Any Additional Costs will be
                    charged in addition to the Price at the applicable rates as notified to you when we provide you with
                    a
                    quotation or when we tell you about the additional Services which are required to obtain
                    confirmation
                    from you as to whether or not you wish to proceed.</p>
                <p>3.3 The Price and any Additional Costs are exclusive of VAT (where applicable)
                    Unless otherwise stated, and VAT will be payable on the Price and any Additional Costs at the
                    applicable
                    current rate chargeable in the United Kingdom for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT
                    changes
                    between the date of your Order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you
                    have
                    already paid for the Services in full before the change in VAT takes effect.</p>
                <p>3.4 Where we are required to undertake any Services or provide additional Goods over and above those
                    set
                    out in our Order due to your default, including but not limited to lack of or incomplete
                    instructions or
                    as a result of the need for additional work becoming apparent during the course of us providing the
                    Services, we reserve the right to charge you for any such additional Services as an Additional Cost.
                </p>
                <p>3.5 If we discover an error in the Price we will contact you as soon as possible. We will provide you
                    with the correct Price, at which point you will have 24 hours to accept or reject the correct Price.
                    If
                    you agree to proceed at the amended correct Price we will refund you or charge you the difference
                    between any amount you have paid and the correct Price. If you are not happy to proceed or we do not
                    hear from you, we will refund you any amount you have already paid and the Contract will be
                    cancelled.</p>

                <p>4. Payment</p>
                <p>4.1 The Price and any Additional Costs, can be paid only by credit or debit card Unless we have
                    agreed
                    to allow you to use an alternative payment method.</p>
                <p>4.2 Payment of the Price and any Additional Costs are due in cleared funds when Your Order is placed
                    with us. We will provide you with an invoice once payment is made. If any Additional Costs arise
                    after
                    your Order is placed, we will discuss these with you and raise an invoice with you which will be
                    payable
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>4.3 If you do not make payment to us in cleared funds when you place your Order, we may: (a)not
                    process
                    your Order until we have received payment of the Price and any Additional Costs in cleared funds;
                    and
                    (b)suspend or cancel all or part of this Contract or any other contract we may have with you.</p>
                <p>4.4 If you do not make payment to us in cleared funds when you place your Order, in addition to the
                    remedies under Condition 4.3, we may charge you interest on the Price at the rate of 3% above the
                    base
                    lending rate of the Bank of England from time to time. Where we charge you interest this shall
                    accrue on
                    a daily basis from the Due Date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether
                    before
                    or after judgement.</p>

                <p>5. Delivery and the Hire Period</p>
                <p>5.1 Once you have placed your Order, the Skip Hire Partner who will be fulfilling your Order will
                    contact you with an estimated delivery date and time for the Services.</p>
                <p>5.2 Delivery of the Services shall take place at the location specified in your order subject to
                    being
                    agreed by us and our Skip Hire Partner (the “Hire Location”). No delivery will be made unless you
                    have a
                    valid Skip Licence (as defined in clause 7.1) in place prior to delivery.</p>
                <p>5.3 The skip will be left with you at the Hire Location for a minimum of 7 days unless we have agreed
                    a
                    different period of time in the Order (the “Hire Period”) unless terminated earlier in accordance
                    with
                    the Contract, and subject to clause 5.6 cannot be moved during the Hire Period once it has been
                    delivered by the Skip Hire Partner.</p>
                <p>5.4 If you do not accept delivery of the Services at the estimated delivery date and time agreed with
                    our Skip Hire Partner or delivery of the Services takes longer than the time slot which has been
                    allowed
                    for in our initial quotation when you placed your Order, or our Skip Hire Partner is unable to
                    collect
                    the skip or complete the Services at the time agreed in the Order, and this is as a result of your
                    actions or failure to act (including a failure to take delivery or permit access to the Hire
                    Location)
                    then we may charge you, as an Additional Cost, a reasonable additional fee to cover the cost of any
                    additional time spent by our Skip Hire Partner attempting to complete the Order beyond the time
                    allowed
                    in our initial quotation when you placed your Order.</p>
                <p>5.5 If you do not accept delivery of the Services within 24 hours of our Skip Hire Partner attempting
                    to
                    deliver the Services then we shall be entitled to terminate our Contract with you in accordance with
                    Condition 11.1 by giving you immediate written notice of our intention to do so.</p>
                <p>5.6 In the event that, following delivery of the skip to the Hire Location, you
                    are required to move or reposition the skip by a highways authority, local authority, by law
                    enforcement or in order to comply with a Skip Licence, you must contact us or the Skip Hire Partner
                    to
                    arrange the movement of the skip. You are not permitted to move the skip yourself. An Additional
                    Cost
                    will be charged for any movement of the skip in accordance with clause 3.2(e).</p>
                <p>5.7 In the event that the Skip Hire Partner has to delay or is unable to complete delivery or
                    collection
                    of a skip under your Order for any reason, including but not limited to as a result of any breakdown
                    or
                    failure in equipment, plant or machinery, it will be the Skip Hire Partner’s responsibility to
                    arrange
                    an alternative date for delivery or collection with you or for an alternate supplier to complete the
                    Order. If the Skip Hire Partner fails to do so, you should contact us and we will arrange another
                    Skip
                    Hire Partner or alternate supplier to complete the Order for you.</p>
                <p>5.8 The skip provided by the Skip Hire Partner shall at all times remain the property of the Skip
                    Hire
                    Partner, and you shall have no right, title or interest in the skip other than the right to use the
                    skip
                    subject to these Conditions.</p>
                <p>5.9 The risk of loss, theft, damage or destruction of the skip shall pass to you when the skip is
                    unloaded by the Skip Hire Partner at the Hire Location. The skip shall remain at your risk during
                    the
                    Hire Period and for any further time until collection by the Skip Hire Partner or a third party
                    arranged
                    by us. Whilst the skip is at the Hire Location, you must comply fully with the provisions of these
                    Conditions.</p>

                <p>7. Skip licences</p>
                <p>7.1 You are not permitted to keep a skip on a public highway without a valid licence
                    issued by the appropriate highway authority or local authority. When placing your Order, you warrant
                    that, unless you have asked us or our Skip Hire Partner to obtain a licence on your behalf, you have
                    a
                    valid licence from the relevant highway authority or local authority permitting you to keep the skip
                    at
                    the Hire Location for the duration of the Hire Period (a “Skip Licence”).</p>
                <p>7.2 Where you are providing the Skip Licence, you must provide a copy of the Skip Licence to us and
                    our
                    Skip Hire Partner, and notify us of the date of expiry of the Skip Licence and any conditions
                    attached
                    to the grant of the Skip Licence.</p>
                <p>7.3 Where you have asked us to arrange a Skip Licence for you, we or our Skip Hire Partner will make
                    an
                    application to the relevant highway authority or local authority on your behalf, and you agree that
                    we
                    may do so. A single application for a Skip Licence will be made on your behalf and, if this is
                    unsuccessful, we or our Skip Hire Partner will not make any further applications unless we have
                    agreed
                    with you that we will do so. Each application for a Skip Licence will be charged as an Additional
                    Cost.</p>
                <p>7.4 Where you have asked us to arrange a Skip Licence for you, you will need to: (a)notify us and our
                    Skip Hire Partner of any previous applications for licences to keep a skip at the Hire Location,
                    including whether those applications were successful and any conditions attached to the grant of
                    such
                    licences; (b)notify us and our Skip Hire Partner of any action taken by a highway authority, local
                    authority or law enforcement in relation to your use of a skip at the Hire Location; (c)provide us
                    and
                    our Skip Hire Partner with any information which we or our Skip Hire Partner request as part of the
                    application process for the Skip Licence as soon as reasonably possible; (d)do anything which we or
                    our
                    Skip Hire Partner request as part of the application process for the Skip Licence as soon as
                    reasonably
                    possible; (e)not do, or permit to be done by any other person, anything that may
                    invalidate, breach or otherwise have a detrimental impact on the Skip Licence; and (f)comply with
                    any
                    conditions attached to the Skip Licence. By asking us to arrange a Skip Licence for you, you
                    acknowledge
                    that you will have no control over the conditions which may be attached to the Skip Licence and that
                    we,
                    and our Skip Hire Partner, shall have no liability to you in the event that you are
                    not satisfied with the conditions attached to the Skip Licence.</p>
                <p>7.5 We, and our Skip Hire Partner, are unable to deliver the Services where there is not a
                    valid Skip Licence in place for the Hire Location. If you have asked us to arrange a Skip Licence,
                    it
                    may take up to 10 working days from the date of application for a Skip Licence to be issued and we
                    will
                    not be liable for any delay in delivering a skip which results from there not being a valid Skip
                    Licence in place at the time of the original estimated delivery date.</p>
                <p>7.6 If you have asked us to arrange a Skip Licence and an application for a Skip Licence has been
                    unsuccessful, we reserve the right to terminate this Contract immediately and refund you the Price,
                    excluding any Additional Costs in relation to the cost of the Skip Licence application(s).</p>

                <p>8. Warranty</p>
                <p>8.1 We will endeavour to transfer to you any warranty given by the Skip Hire Partner in relation to
                    any
                    Services supplied. We do not offer any warranty or guarantee other than as set out in the Conditions
                    or
                    implied by law.</p>
                <p>8.2 Any images or descriptions of Services on our Site are for illustrative purposes only. Although
                    we
                    have made every effort to display and describe the Services accurately, we cannot guarantee that the
                    images and descriptions on our Site are accurate and Services may vary slightly from those images
                    and
                    descriptions provided.</p>

                <p>9. Your rights of cancellation, return and refund</p>
                <p>9.1 Except as set out in Conditions 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 and 9.8 below, where you decide to cancel the
                    Contract
                    we will refund you the Price which you have already paid using the payment method used by you to
                    pay.</p>
                <p>9.2 If you wish to cancel the Contract in relation to the provision of any Services, you cannot do so
                    once we have started to deliver the Services, including once our Skip Hire Partner has begun to
                    deliver
                    the skip at the Hire Location. If you cancel after we have started to deliver the Services, you must
                    pay
                    us for the Services provided up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind and
                    cancelled the Contract.</p>
                <p>9.3 When you place an order you have a cancellation right in relation to the services you have
                    ordered
                    which allows you to cancel the contract within 14 days of placing your Order in order to receive a
                    full
                    refund. However, if you request that we provide the Services within 14 days of the date of your
                    Order,
                    you will not be able to cancel the Order once we have started to deliver the Services. You can
                    cancel
                    your Contract with us at any point before we commence performance of the Services by contacting us
                    as
                    set out in Condition 1.3 and including the information outlined in Condition 1.3.
                    (a)If you contact us because you wish to cancel the Contract less than 24 hours before the estimated
                    delivery time we may retain a reasonable proportion of the Price and Additional Costs up to 50% of
                    the
                    Price and Additional Costs of your Order. (b)If you cancel the Contract whilst our Skip Hire Partner
                    is
                    travelling to deliver the Services we may retain a reasonable proportion of the Price and Additional
                    Costs of your Order to cover our administrative costs, the cost of assigning a Skip Hire Partner to
                    deliver the Services and the Skip Hire Partner’s cost in travelling to deliver the Services.</p>
                <p>9.4 You also have legal rights in relation to services which are not performed with reasonable care
                    and
                    skill or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by your right of return and refund in
                    this Condition 9 or anything else in these Terms. Advice about your legal rights is available from
                    your
                    local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. After you have purchased the Services,
                    your
                    legal rights entitle you to request the re-performance of the Services or, if this would not be
                    possible
                    or could not be easily done within a reasonable time, a price
                    reduction, where the Services have not been performed with reasonable care and skill or are not as
                    described.</p>
                <p>9.5 If you exercise your legal right to ask for a reduction in the Price we will make any refund due
                    to
                    you as soon as possible and in any event within 14 days after the day on which you notify us of your
                    valid request for a reduction in the Price.</p>

                <p>10. Our liability to you</p>
                <p>10.1 We do not in any way exclude or limit our liability for: (a)death or personal injury caused by
                    our
                    negligence; (b)fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
                <p>10.2 We will not be liable to you in relation to the acts or omissions of our Skip Hire Partner
                    that cause you loss or damage, but if you have a complaint in relation to our Skip Hire Partner
                    please
                    contact us and we will help you to resolve it with our Skip Hire Partner directly.</p>
                <p>10.3 If we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is
                    a
                    foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for
                    any
                    loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious
                    consequence of
                    our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time we entered into this contract.</p>
                <p>10.4 We only supply the Services for domestic and private use. You agree not to use or purchase our
                    Services for any commercial, business or resale purposes, and we have no liability to you for any
                    loss
                    of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
                <p>10.5 Subject as expressly provided in these Terms, all warranties, conditions or other terms implied
                    by
                    statute or common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. In particular, we make no
                    warranty as to the fitness of the skip for any particular purpose even if that purpose is stated in
                    your
                    Order. This exclusion includes recommendations or advice from us to you relating to a specific
                    enquiry.
                    You must satisfy yourself as to the fitness for the purpose for which the skip is intended.</p>
                <p>10.6 We shall not be liable for a breach of warranty in accordance with Condition 8 unless: (a)you
                    give
                    written notice of the breach to us within 2 days of discovery of the defect; and (b)we are given a
                    reasonable opportunity after receiving the notice to examine the result of the Services and you
                    comply
                    with any request from us to enable us to inspect the result of the Services.</p>
                <p>10.7 We shall not be liable for breach of warranty under Condition 8 if: (a)you make any further use
                    of
                    the skip provided as part of the Services or the result of the Services after giving notice under
                    Condition 10.6(a); or (b)the breach arises because you have failed to follow our or the Skip Hire
                    Partner’s instructions (whether oral or in writing) in relation to the Services or (if there are
                    none)
                    good trade practice; or (c)you interfere with or alter the provision of the Services or attempt to
                    rectify or alter the result of the Services without our written consent.</p>
                <p>10.8 Where any valid claim in respect of the Services is made by you, we shall be entitled at our
                    option
                    to: (a)re-perform the Services where found not to conform to warranty at our cost; or (b)at our sole
                    discretion, refund to you the Price (or a proportionate part of the Price), excluding Additional
                    Costs
                    other than where such Additional Costs relate to the aspect of the Services about which you have
                    made a
                    valid claim, of the Services found not to conform to warranty, and subject to Condition 10.1 we
                    shall
                    have no further liability to you.</p>
                <p>10.9 Subject to Condition 10.1, our liability in connection with the sale and supply of the Services
                    shall be as follows: (a)in respect of any loss of profits, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss
                    of
                    anticipated savings or loss of use, our liability shall be nil; (b)for any type of consequential,
                    special or indirect loss or damage, our liability shall be nil; and (c)in respect of all other types
                    of
                    direct loss (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) our total aggregate liability under the
                    Contract
                    shall not exceed the total Price of the Services.</p>
                <p>10.10 Any claim by you under this Condition 10 in respect of any Services shall not entitle you to
                    withhold or delay payment in respect of any other goods or services in respect of which no such
                    claim
                    has been made whether or not those goods or services form part of the same Contract.</p>

                <p>11. Termination and Consequences</p>
                <p>11.1 Without prejudice to any other remedies or rights under the Contract or otherwise, we may
                    terminate
                    the Contract with you at any time by giving you written notice if you: (a)commit a material breach
                    of
                    any of the Terms, which shall include non-payment of the Price or any Additional Costs, failure to
                    accept delivery of any Services within 24 hours of us, or our Skip Hire Partner, first attempting to
                    make delivery, and (if such breach is remediable), fail to remedy the breach within such time period
                    deemed appropriate by us at the time, of being notified in writing; or (b)are the subject of a
                    bankruptcy petition or order or we believe it reasonably likely that you will be the subject of a
                    bankruptcy petition or order.</p>
                <p>11.2 Upon termination of the Contract for any reason:
                    (a)we or our Skip Hire Partner may collect any skip currently in use at any point following
                    termination;
                    (b)if you have made full payment for any Services we or our Skip Hire Partner may deliver them to
                    you or
                    alternatively refund you the Price and any Additional Costs at our discretion; or (c)if you have not
                    made full payment we, or our Skip Hire Partner may refund you any part of the Price which you have
                    paid
                    less our reasonable administrative costs; and in each case the accrued rights and remedies of each
                    party
                    as at termination and the continuation of any provision expressly stated to survive or implicitly
                    surviving termination, shall not be affected.</p>

                <p>12. Complaints</p>
                <p>12.1 If you have any complaints, you can contact us using the contact details in condition 1.3.</p>

                    data
                    in accordance with the Privacy Policy available on our Site. Please ensure you read the Privacy
                    Policy
                    as it includes important information which will apply to you.</p>

                <p>14. Events outside of our control</p>
                <p>14.1 We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any
                    of
                    our obligations under a Contract that is caused by any event or event which is beyond our reasonable
                    control (“Event Outside Our Control”).</p>
                <p>14.2 If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations or
                    those of our Skip Hire Partner under a Contract: (a)we will contact you as soon as reasonably
                    possible
                    to notify you; and (b)our obligations and those of our Skip Hire Partner under a Contract will be
                    suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the
                    Event
                    Outside Our Control. Where the Event Outside Our Control affects delivery times we will arrange a
                    new
                    delivery time, as appropriate, with you after the Event Outside Our Control is over.</p>
                <p>14.3 You may cancel a Contract if it is affected by an Event Outside Our Control which has continued
                    for
                    more than 5 days. To cancel please contact us. If you opt to cancel, we will refund any part of the
                    Price which you have already paid.</p>

                <p>15. Our right to vary these Terms</p>
                <p>15.1 We amend these Terms from time to time. We state at the beginning of the Terms when they were
                    last
                    updated. Every time you place an Order with us, the Terms in force at the time of your Order will
                    apply
                    to the Contract between you and us.</p>
                <p>15.2 We may revise these Terms as they apply to your Order from time to time to reflect any changes
                    in
                    relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p>15.3 If we have to revise these Terms as they apply to your Order, we will contact you to give you
                    reasonable advance notice of the changes and let you know how to cancel the Contract if you are not
                    happy with the changes. If you opt to cancel, we will refund any part of the Price which you have
                    already paid.</p>

                <p>16. Other important terms</p>
                <p>16.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another organisation, but this
                    will
                    not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.</p>
                <p>16.2 Where we refer to “in writing” in these Terms, this includes email.</p>
                <p>16.3 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we
                    agree in writing.</p>
                <p>16.4 This Contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its
                    terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.</p>
                <p>16.5 Each of the Conditions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority
                    decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining Conditions will remain in full
                    force and effect.</p>
                <p>16.6 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not
                    enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived
                    our
                    rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do
                    waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will
                    automatically
                    waive any later default by you.</p>
                <p>16.7 Please note that these Terms are governed by English law. This means a Contract for the purchase
                    of
                    Services and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by
                    English
                    law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction.
                    However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern
                    Ireland,
                    and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.</p>
